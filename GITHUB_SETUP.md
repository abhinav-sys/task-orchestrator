# 🚀 GitHub Setup Instructions

Your project is ready to push to GitHub! Follow these steps:

## Step 1: Create GitHub Repository

1. Go to https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `task-orchestrator` (or your preferred name)
3. Description: "Production-grade distributed task processing and API platform built with Python, FastAPI, and Clean Architecture"
4. Choose **Public** (or Private if you prefer)
5. **DO NOT** initialize with README, .gitignore, or license (we already have them)
6. Click "Create repository"

## Step 2: Connect and Push

After creating the repository, GitHub will show you commands. Use these:

```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd "C:\Users\Aspire7\Desktop\git hub projects\boost2\task-orchestrator"

# Add remote (replace YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username)
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/task-orchestrator.git

# Rename branch to main (if needed)
git branch -M main

# Push to GitHub
git push -u origin main
```

## Step 3: Verify on GitHub

1. Go to your repository on GitHub
2. You should see all your files
3. Check that README.md displays correctly
4. Verify the project structure

## Step 4: Add Topics/Tags (Optional but Recommended)

On your GitHub repository page:

1. Click the gear icon ⚙️ next to "About"
2. Add topics:
   - `python`
   - `fastapi`
   - `postgresql`
   - `celery`
   - `redis`
   - `docker`
   - `clean-architecture`
   - `async`
   - `rest-api`
   - `microservices`

   - `backend`

3. Add website URL if you deploy it later

## Step 5: Pin Repository (Optional)
